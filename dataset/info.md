The SAMSum dataset contains about 16k messenger-like conversations with summaries. Conversations were created and written down by linguists fluent in English. Linguists were asked to create conversations similar to those they write on a daily basis, reflecting the proportion of topics of their real-life messenger convesations. The style and register are diversified - conversations could be informal, semi-formal or formal, they may contain slang words, emoticons and typos. Then, the conversations were annotated with summaries. It was assumed that summaries should be a concise brief of what people talked about in the conversation in third person. The SAMSum dataset was prepared by Samsung R&D Institute Poland and is distributed for research purposes (non-commercial licence: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).
